                                <strong>Introduction:</strong> <br>
                                Human-caused climate change has been having more severe global consequences since the beginning of the industrial revolution a century ago. Extreme weather conditions is an example of one of these effects. Across Pakistan, from the Himalayas to the Indus River plains, climate change poses a threat to the country's diverse ecosystems. Due to climate change, the United States is rethinking its approach to a sustainable future as glaciers melt, heat waves become more intense, and ecosystems are disrupted. In terms of climate risk, Pakistan ranks eighth worst in the world in 2021. List of serious dangers presented by climate change on Pakistan.

                            <p>
                                <strong>The link between climate change and Extreme Weather:</strong> <br>
                                The amount of pollutants in the air, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, has steadily increased since the industrial revolution. As a result of the greenhouse effect, these gases are problematic. There has been a gradual increase of 0.08 degrees Celsius every decade in the average global temperature, and ultimately Pakistan is also impacted. As a result, climate change happens, which is now one of the most pressing issues.
                            </p>       
                            <p>
                                <strong>Factors contributing to climate change in Pakistan:</strong> <br>
                                Loss of arable land and increased climate impact are both consequences of deforestation
                                to make way for cities and industry. DHA, the military housing authority in Multan, was
                                constructed by razing around 6,000 acres of mango orchards, making it one among the more
                                recent incidents. Mango exports fell and the topsoil they relied on was ruined. Land
                                that is not suitable for agricultural use should be used for housing cooperatives and
                                programs.
                                Wastewater and a large amount of potentially useful land and water are being wasted due
                                to poor management. Most factories just dump their trash into natural habitats without
                                any kind of treatment. All domestic Brick kilns release smoke into the atmosphere, but
                                their owners lack the resources and knowledge to do anything about it. The role of law
                                enforcement authorities is crucial in this situation.

                                <strong>Impacts of climate change on Pakistan:</strong> <br>
                                These are some impacts of climate change on Pakistan.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Increase in intensity of heat waves:</strong> <br>
                                There are a number of environmental factors that contribute to heat waves in Pakistan.
                                The closeness of the Arabian Sea and desert to the nation, as well as its subtropical
                                latitude, contribute to heat waves and climate change in the area. The fire is fanned by
                                urbanization, industry, and the heat island effect in highly populated areas.
                                Heat waves are becoming more intense and common as a result of global warming. In recent
                                years, heat waves have become more regular in Pakistan throughout the summer, raising
                                the temperature to intolerable heights. Officials in several parts of Sindh and Southern
                                Punjab have urged residents to remain indoors and only go out when absolutely essential.
                                This extreme weather has damaging impacts on both people and the natural world. Heat
                                strokes and heart problems become more common. Those who are most vulnerable include the
                                young, the old, and those who already struggle with poor health.

                            </p>

                                <strong>Rising sea levels:</strong> <br>
                                One of the most immediate consequences of climate change throughout the world, including
                                in Pakistan, is a rise in sea levels. Normal increases in temperature have also
                                contributed to glacier melting. Northern regions, home to more than 7,000 glaciers, are
                                predicted to see temperature increases of 4 degrees or more. Rising temperatures
                                throughout the world cause glaciers to melt, ice sheets to become unstable, and seas to
                                expand, threatening coastal communities.
                                The length of Pakistan's coastline along the Arabian Sea is around 10,000 kilometers.
                                It's been said that Extreme weather conditions have made Pakistan's coasts particularly
                                susceptible. Coastal erosion and flooding threats both worsen when sea levels rise due
                                to the increased force of waves and tides. It's bad for coastal communities, the
                                environment, and infrastructure.
                                Extreme weather and climate change also presents a significant threat in the form of
                                salt water intrusion. The quality of crops irrigated with freshwater is negatively
                                affected by increasing sea levels, and people and other forms of life are also put in
                                danger by the introduction of salty water. Extreme climate change causes flooding and
                                storm surges. Human lives are lost, communities are uprooted, economies are hampered,
                                and habitat is destroyed

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Change in rainfall patterns:</strong> <br>
                                Climate change has made it a top priority in recent years. Unpredictable and wildly
                                fluctuating in both time and intensity, the rains in Pakistan have far-reaching and
                                devastating effects throughout the country. As a result of changes in the frequency and
                                intensity of rainfall, agricultural output, crop quality, and animal production may all
                                suffer. Hailstorms are disastrous for agricultural production. When agricultural exports
                                drop dramatically, the rest of Pakistan's economy feels the pinch.
                                People are increasingly uneasy about the neglected topic of water resources management.
                                Flash flooding happens when the drainage system is overwhelmed. While there is a demand
                                for water for agricultural and industrial uses, this surplus is being squandered.
                                Rainfall is a major factor in structuring ecosystems, which causes changes to occur. The
                                inability of certain plants and spices to adjust to a changing climate disrupts the
                                natural order of things.
                                In addition to floods, other extreme weather conditions that Pakistan must deal with
                                include drought and water shortages. The mismanagement of water supplies is a major
                                contributor. Some regions of the nation suffer severely from water surplus, while others
                                suffer greatly from water scarcity.
                                The provinces of Sindh and Balochistan have been hit worst by the drought. Drought and
                                water shortages may occur when extreme weather results in lower-than-average
                                precipitation in some regions. In 2018, the monsoon season rainfall in Pakistan was 24.4
                                percent below normal, 69.5 percent below average in Sindh, and 45.4 percent below
                                average in Balochistan. Pakistan is still on the list of nations at risk of drought.
                                Health and lifestyles, especially those of children and women, are being damaged for
                                millions of people despite government relief efforts.
                                Waterborne infections are common because there isn't enough clean water available for
                                sanitation and household usage, which contributes to a lower standard of living.
                                Inadequate irrigation water reduces crop quality and productivity, animal mortality, and
                                food security, all of which slow a country's economic development.

                                <strong>Adaptive measures:</strong> <br>
                                Our efforts to lessen the effects of climate change and extreme weather should be
                                implemented as soon as possible, before it's too late. To adapt to shifting rainfall
                                patterns and equitable water distribution throughout the nation, effective water
                                management is essential. It will boost agricultural land availability and economic
                                development while decreasing the effects of droughts and water shortages.
                                Improvements in infrastructure, a greater emphasis on cutting-edge agricultural methods,
                                and the planting of trees are all good places to start. Self-awareness is the first step
                                toward change, hence raising public knowledge of climate change in Pakistan and its
                                effects is essential

                                While climate change poses a significant danger to mankind today, we have the power to
                                make a difference and aid in Earth's recovery if we work together. Learn as much as you
                                can about climate change and its impacts on Pakistan and share that knowledge with

                                environment. If you must dispose of trash, sort it into different bins for different
                                materials like paper, plastic, and liquids. This will greatly facilitate recycling and
                                improve the efficiency of trash management.
                                Take the bus or the train instead of driving your own car to lessen your impact on the
                                environment. To reduce pollution, only drive vehicles equipped with catalytic
                                converters. Each everyone must do their share to lessen the impacts of climate change on
                                Pakistan.
                                Help organizations and other sustainable projects battle climate change to have an
                                impact on a larger scale. Don't be shy about helping out nonprofits if you have to offer
                                your time. These groups tackle the problem on a larger scale, which will have a lasting
                                and maybe future-saving influence in the fight against climate change

                                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>
                                Without a doubt, climate change is having a negative impact on the people, economy, and
                                ecology of Pakistan. Extreme weather is becoming more often, rainfall patterns are
                                becoming more chaotic, glaciers are melting, and temperatures are increasing, all of
                                which are causing problems for the nation. Agriculture, water resources, health, and
                                even ways of life are just a few sectors that feel the repercussions.
                                Agriculture is a lifeline for millions of Pakistanis, but climate change is having a
                                devastating effect on the country. Unpredictable precipitation and prolonged droughts
                                are the root causes of water shortages, crop failures, and falling agricultural output.
                                This threatens food security and exacerbates existing inequalities in wealth.
                                And as the Himalayan glaciers melt, they pose a major danger to Pakistan's water supply.
                                The melting of glaciers creates lakes and rivers. Retreating glaciers are a major source
                                of water scarcity, particularly during the crucial summer months when agricultural
                                production is at its peak. Because of this water shortage, hydropower generation, the
                                economy, and farming are all affected. If Pakistan implements thorough efforts and
                                interacts with the international community, it may help future generations have a more
                                resilient and sustainable future.

                                        Climate Change is such an alarming situation for each one of us. This blog is
                                        really helpful in spreading awareness related to the hot topic being discussed
                                        everywhere in the world. I hope I would see more content related to that soon!

                                        Climate Change being one of the SDG's (Sustainable Development Goals) needs
                                        groups and clubs to raise awareness about it. I hope you guys keep going and
                                        provide information about its more impacts.
